# Voice-Enabled Assistant for Home Healthcare

This project intends to develop a voice assistant for home healthcare that uses automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies to interact with patients.

This voice assistant is designed to respond to two types of patient queries:

- Symptoms recognition: Patients can describe their symptoms to the voice assistant, which uses NLU to recognize the symptoms and suggest possible diseases.
  e.g. query — “I am having constant pain in the head”, so the output will be: Headache

- Treatment procedure: Patients can ask the voice assistant for information about a specific disease, and it will provide information on the treatment procedure.
  Telling treatment procedure by recognizing the disease
  e.g. query — “How to treat fever at home?”, so the output will be:

1. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.
2. Dress in lightweight clothing.
3. Use a light blanket if you feel chilled, until the chills end.
4. Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).
5. Get medical help if the fever lasts more than five days in a row.
